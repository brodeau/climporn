# climporn

Who cares about the scientific quality of your work! It's all about the fanciness of the plots and the movies you show to the audience right !?

More seriously, *climporn* is a collection of scripts to generate "climate-porn"-qualified images + videos out of ocean GCMs output...

Example: https://vimeo.com/300943265

<!--
In order for *climporn* to work, add the ``climporn/python/python`` directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.
In the civilized Unix world, this is done by adding the following line in your ``${HOME}/.bashrc`` or ``${HOME}/.profile``

    export PYTHONPATH=<YOUR_INSTALLATION_PATH>/climporn/python/python:${PYTHONPATH}
-->

Peace!
